Scala MediaVision
=================

This folder contains the Scala version of MediaVision. It is built using the SBT tool. Run SBT
in the top level folder to build and manage both the `mediavision` and `mediatool` projects. For
example, to compile both projects use:

```bash
$ sbt compile
```

To run the MediaTool:

```bash
$ sbt "mediatool/run"
```
