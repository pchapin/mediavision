Ada MediaVision
===============

This folder contains two Alire crates. The `mediavision` crate builds the library. The
`mediatool` crate builds a command-line application that uses and demonstrates the library.
After installing [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/), change into either folder and run `alr build`
to build the corresponding component. Building mediatool will also build the mediavison library.

In `mediavision` there is a test program in the `tests` folder. That folder contains another
Alire crate that can be built and run for testing.
