MediaVision
===========

This project is about creating a library to manipulate various multimedia objects (images,
movies, audio data, etc). The intention is not to create a general purpose file editing utility
but instead to expose the internal structure of these file formats to inspection and editing at
the lowest levels. This project is part of the Vision meta-project.

Three separate languages are supported: C++, Ada/SPARK, and Scala.
